One of the first steps in creating a website is adding text. All of Website.com’s templates are pre-populated with sample content, including text. The sample content is intended to give you a head start by showing you the content you can have, and a possible way to arrange them on your web page. 
Text is added via drag-and-drop. This means, once you have click on the add text button, a placeholder textbox will be added to your web page. You can drag the textbox to the desired location and then edit the text as you wish.

As you can see, the selection of text you can add to your website quite complete. Note that these are all themed font style – font styles that are based on the template design. This is to ensure font style is consistent throughout your website.

Once you have selected the font style that you want to add, a placeholder textbox will be added to your web page and all you need to do is drag and drop it to the desired location on your web page. Because Website.com uses absolute positioning, you can drop the text virtually anywhere on your web page.
